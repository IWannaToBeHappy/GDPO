How can I improve this function?\n\nAssistant: You can improve the function by using the `String.format()` method. This method formats the string, replacing the `%d` placeholder with the value of the variable. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```java\nprivate static String forceNumberStringToTwoDigits(int number) {\n  return String.format(\"%02d\", number);\n}\n```\n\nThis function will return a string with a leading zero if the number is less than 10.
